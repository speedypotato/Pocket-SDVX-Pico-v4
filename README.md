## Addendum
As promised many months ago, Speedy Labs' most popular product is now open sourced.  Pocket-SDVX-Pico v4 is my second PCB, and therefore everything's a little bit sloppy.  Nevertheless, everything here is functional and has been self-learned online along with the help of the community.  Thanks for all the support!

FYI I should probably let everyone know the most common defects I've received:
- RGB LEDs dead or not soldered properly
- Extra Aux Button wobbly/non-functional/misaligned
- Smudged Silkscreen

There's probably a 5% chance of this happening according to my statistics.  Nothing you can do about it aside from repairing it yourself.
