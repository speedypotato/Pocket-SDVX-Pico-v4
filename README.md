## Addendum
As promised many months ago, Speedy Labs' most popular product is now open sourced.  Pocket-SDVX-Pico v4 is my second PCB, and therefore everything's a little bit sloppy.  Nevertheless, everything here is functional and has been self-learned online along with the help of the community.  Thanks for all the support!
